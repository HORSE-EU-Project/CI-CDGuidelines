# Guidelines
We have developed some basic guidelines in order to facilitate the process of working with CI/CD for all the partners. The Guide can be found in [this file](Horse%20GitHub%20CICD%20Guide.pdf).

## Examples
To help with the understanding of the presented examples that can be found in the guide, we have also uploaded them to this repository. They are in different branches:

- python
- nodejs
- java

Each brach corresponds to the programming language used.
